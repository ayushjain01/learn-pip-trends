# Article Image Guidelines

There are two main images that you'll need to create for an article. The front matter for these is -

```markdown
---
image: Add relative url to the article preview image here
cover: Add relative url to the article icon here
---
```

The key tags are `image`, `cover`. Each tag serves a different purpose.

- `image` - This tag represents the preview image that will be visible when the article is shared on social media. Here's an example of this image. This image is also appears at the top of your article

    **Dimensions - 1200x630 px**

  <center> <img src = "../../assets/images/article-images/preview-image.png" alt = "preview image"> 
  <img src = "../../assets/images/article-images/image.png" alt = "preview image"></center>

- `cover` - This tag represents the icon image that will be displayed on the homepage along with the article title and description.

  **Dimensions - 800x800 px**

<center> <img src = "../../assets/images/article-images/cover.png" alt = "article cover image"> </center>

As a standard design practice at [learn.piptrends.com](../../), the ```image```, and the ```cover``` share the same background gradient.
